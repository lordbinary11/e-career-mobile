# Logout Modal Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a custom centered logout confirmation modal that replaces the default `Alert.alert` system.

## Problem
The default `Alert.alert` function in React Native doesn't provide positioning control, and the logout confirmation dialog wasn't appearing in the center of the screen as desired.

## Solution
Created a custom `LogoutModal` component that:
- Appears centered on the screen
- Has a semi-transparent overlay
- Features a modern, card-based design
- Includes proper animations and shadows
- Is responsive to different screen sizes

## Files Modified

### New Component
- `components/LogoutModal.js` - Custom logout confirmation modal

### Updated Files
- `app/(tabs)/dashboardUser.js` - Replaced Alert.alert with LogoutModal
- `app/dashboardCounselor.js` - Replaced Alert.alert with LogoutModal  
- `app/(tabs)/profileUser.js` - Replaced Alert.alert with LogoutModal
- `app/profileCounselor.js` - Replaced Alert.alert with LogoutModal

## Features

### Visual Design
- **Centered positioning** - Modal appears in the exact center of the screen
- **Semi-transparent overlay** - Darkens the background for focus
- **Modern card design** - Rounded corners with shadows
- **Responsive sizing** - Adapts to different screen sizes (85% width, max 400px)

### User Experience
- **Smooth animations** - Fade-in/out transitions
- **Clear visual hierarchy** - Icon, title, message, and buttons
- **Accessible buttons** - Clear Cancel and Logout options
- **Touch-friendly** - Proper button sizing and spacing

### Technical Features
- **Modal component** - Uses React Native's Modal API
- **State management** - Controlled visibility through props
- **Event handling** - Proper close and confirm callbacks
- **Cross-platform** - Works on both iOS and Android

## Usage

### Basic Implementation
```javascript
import LogoutModal from '../components/LogoutModal';

const [showLogoutModal, setShowLogoutModal] = useState(false);

const handleLogout = async () => {
  setShowLogoutModal(false);
  await clearAllAuthData();
  router.replace('/login');
};

// In your JSX
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setShowLogoutModal(true)}>
  <Text>Logout</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>

<LogoutModal 
  visible={showLogoutModal}
  onClose={() => setShowLogoutModal(false)}
  onConfirm={handleLogout}
/>
```

### Props
- `visible` (boolean) - Controls modal visibility
- `onClose` (function) - Called when modal should close
- `onConfirm` (function) - Called when logout is confirmed

## Benefits

1. **Better UX** - Centered positioning improves user experience
2. **Consistent design** - Matches the app's visual style
3. **Customizable** - Easy to modify appearance and behavior
4. **Reusable** - Can be used across different screens
5. **Professional look** - More polished than native alerts

## Future Enhancements

- Add haptic feedback on button press
- Implement different animation types
- Add support for custom themes
- Include additional confirmation options
- Add accessibility improvements (VoiceOver, TalkBack)

## Testing

The logout modal has been tested on:
- Android emulator
- iOS simulator
- Different screen sizes
- Various device orientations

All logout functionality works correctly and the modal appears properly centered on all tested devices.
